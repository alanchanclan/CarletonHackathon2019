Welcome to our eCommerce hack! This repo allows you to do the following with ease:
1. Take images of anything you wish to shop
2. Get informed about the best deals, vendors, and reviews of products similar to what you presented!

`Dependencies`
To use this product, make sure you have on your device:
* Python 3.x interpreter ([here!](https://www.python.org/))
* Browser webdriver for Chrome (if you are running it) ([here!](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads))

That's it! Run the `driver.py` program and follow the instructions! Take an image of the product you are shopping in the camera booth, download it as "buyme.jpg" (by default), and we'll handle the rest!
